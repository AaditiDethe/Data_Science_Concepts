# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python:

This document explains the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python with examples.

1. Introduction to OOP

   ->Class: A blueprint for creating objects.

   ->Object: An instance of a class with unique attributes and behaviors.

   ->Constructor (__init__ method): A special method used to initialize an object, which does not return a value.

2. Inheritance

   ->Inheritance allows a child class to acquire properties and methods from a base class.

   ->It enables code reusability and organization.

3. Multiple Inheritance

   ->A child class can inherit from multiple parent classes.

   ->Useful when a class needs functionality from multiple sources.

4. Summary

   ->Classes and Objects define the structure of a program.

   ->Constructors initialize object attributes.

   ->Inheritance allows reuse and extension of existing code.

   ->Multiple Inheritance enables a class to acquire behaviors from multiple parents.

OOP is essential for writing scalable and maintainable Python programs!
